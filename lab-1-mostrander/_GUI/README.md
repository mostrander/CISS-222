# CISS222 Spring 2021 - Lab 1

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab is two-fold. First, it is to help you get better acquainted with GitHub, which is a tool we will be using this semester, and one (or something similar) that you will likely use in a career in programming. Second, it is important to know that the standard point-and-click operations you are used to with Visual Studio (VS) aren't the only options. You can use the command line completely independently of VS to do a lot of what you can do within VS' GUI (graphical user interface). Once you know the options available to you, it becomes a matter of preference on how often you use the GUI and how often you use the command line.

## Objective
You will complete the exact same result twice - the creation of a stub C# console app that is checked into a remote GitHub repository. You will be given directions on completing this via the VS GUI, as well as completing this via the command line without using VS at all.

## Expectations and Grading
1. (15 pts) Complete the Visual Studio GUI instructions for creating a C# console app and committing it to a GitHub remote repository.
1. (15 pts) Complete the command line instructions for creating a C# console app and committing it to a GitHub remote repository.
1. (5 pts) Answer all of the questions asked.

## Assignment Retrieval, Testing, and Submission
1. Pull down this repository from GitHub to your local machine.
1. There is an instruction file named [lab1-instructions.md](lab1-instructions.md) in this repository. This file contains the instructions for completing this assignment. You will need to edit this file within GitHub using your browser. You will need to edit this file to provide, as requested:
   1. Answers to the questions asked
   1. Screenshots documenting the progress of your work
1. You can check in your work, as well as push to GitHub, as infrequently or as often as you wish. However, you must ensure that your work is checked in and pushed, as that will be how your assignment is turned in. The code as of the due date and time will be the version that will be graded.
