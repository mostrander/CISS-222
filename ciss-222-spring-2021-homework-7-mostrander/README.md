# CISS222 Spring 2021 - Homework 7

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to use a variety of program flow techniques and operators in a single program.

## Objective
There is a classic programming exercise known as "FizzBuzz." In this exercise, you will need to implement FizzBuzz.

The rules of FizzBuzz are the following:
```
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.
```
You will need the output to be once per line:
```
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
```
... and so forth, until you get to 100.


## Expectations and Grading
1. (1 pts) All of the lines that should display numbers in sequence 1-100 display correctly
1. (3 pts) All of the lines that should display "Fizz" in sequence 1-100 display correctly
1. (3 pts) All of the lines that should display "Buzz" in sequence 1-100 display correctly
1. (3 pts) All of the lines that should display "FizzBuzz" in sequence 1-100 display correctly

## Assignment Retrieval, Testing, and Submission
1. Pull down this repository from GitHub to your local machine and open the solution in Visual Studio.
1. You can check in your work, as well as push to GitHub, as infrequently or as often as you wish. However, you must ensure that your work is checked in and pushed, as that will be how your assignment is turned in. The code as of the due date and time will be the version that will be graded.
