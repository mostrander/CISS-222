# CISS222 Spring 2020 - Homework 2 - Instructions

## Notes
* Make sure that you have pulled down this repository to your local machine, and you have opened this file for editing within GitHub
* All tasks that need to be completed will have an empty checkbox icon displayed next to it. You do not have to check the boxes as you complete the steps, but you can if you want. This is done using Markdown syntax. [More information about Markdown syntax for checklists can be found here](https://github.blog/2014-04-28-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents/).
* At the end of the instructions, there will be a series of questions to answer based on your work in the assignment.
* You can check in your work, as well as push to GitHub, as infrequently or as often as you wish. However, you must ensure that your work is checked in and pushed, as that will be how your assignment is turned in. The code as of the due date and time will be the version that will be graded.
